# Github_selfHostedRunner


This is a repo which i uesd to demonstrate a cicd that runs on github self hosted runner 

Sometimes github's provided runner is not enough
it can be in terms of 
* compute
* security
* runner time
* pricing (for private repos as it is limited to some minutes)

in that case we use something known as github self hosted runner which we host on our own server and it can be pretty reliable at times :)
