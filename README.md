## Github Self-Hosted Runner

**Demonstrate CI/CD Automation with Custom GitHub Actions Runner**

---

### üöÄ Project Overview

A robust, scalable, and secure **self-hosted GitHub Actions runner** designed to power high-performance **CI/CD pipelines** for modern **backend development**, **DevOps**, and **Cloud Engineering** workflows. Leverage this solution to optimize compute resources, enforce custom security policies, reduce runtime costs, and integrate seamlessly with container orchestration platforms.

**Key Use Cases:**

* **Backend Developer**: Accelerate build, test, and deployment cycles for **Node.js**, **Python**, **Go**, and **Java** services.
* **DevOps Engineer / SRE**: Manage **infrastructure as code (IaC)**, implement **continuous integration**, **continuous deployment**, and monitor **high-availability** runners.
* **Platform Engineer**: Orchestrate self-hosted runners across **AWS**, **Azure**, **GCP**, **Kubernetes**, and on-premise servers.

---

### üîë Core Features

* **CI/CD Automation** using **GitHub Actions** with custom runner registration
* **Scalability & Reliability**: Horizontal scaling, load-balanced runners, auto-registration
* **Security & Isolation**: Granular access control, network isolation, encrypted communication
* **Cost Optimization**: Eliminate per-minute billing, leverage existing compute infrastructure
* **Container Support**: Dockerized runner images, integration with **Kubernetes** and **Docker Swarm**
* **Monitoring & Logging**: Plug into **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **ELK Stack**, or any **REST API**

---

### üì• Installation & Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:

   * Linux/Windows/macOS Server with Docker and Git installed
   * GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo`, `admin:repo_hook` scopes

2. **Clone Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yagyagoel1/Github_selfHostedRunner.git
   cd Github_selfHostedRunner
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables** (.env):

   ```ini
   GITHUB_URL=https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>
   RUNNER_NAME=custom-runner-01
   RUNNER_TOKEN=<YOUR_PAT_TOKEN>
   RUNNER_WORKDIR=_work
   ```

4. **Launch Runner**:

   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

5. **Verify Registration**:

   * Check GitHub Repo Settings ‚ñ∂ Actions ‚ñ∂ Runners

### üìã Usage Example

Once configured, include the self-hosted runner in your workflow YAML:

```yaml
name: Build & Deploy Backend
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Docker Build & Push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
```

---

### üö• CI/CD Pipeline Integration

* **Custom Docker Image**: Build a Docker image of this runner for repeatable deployments.
* **Auto-Registration Scripts**: Use Terraform `null_resource` or Ansible playbooks to auto-provision and register runners.
* **Kubernetes DaemonSet**: Deploy a DaemonSet to ensure each node auto-registers a runner instance.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

* Restrict runner permissions to required repositories
* Use **IAM Roles** and secure storage for PATs
* Enable **network isolation** (VPC, firewall rules)
* Regularly update runner binaries and Docker images

---

### üìà Scaling & Monitoring

* **Horizontal Scaling**: Deploy multiple runner instances with load-balancing
* **Metrics Exporter**: Expose `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping
* **Log Aggregation**: Centralize logs with ELK Stack or AWS CloudWatch Logs
